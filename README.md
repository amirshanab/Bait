# Bait

## Description
Bait, our grocery app offers all the common features needed in an online grocery application, but we stand out with the recipeâ€™s feature,
what makes this special is that everything you need is in one place, we are trying to create a complete ecosystem for our customers, the recipes, ingredients,
how to cook the dish, checkout and delivery is all in one app. In addition to that, we are planning to add a make your own dish feature,
where each user can create a template of his favorite meals to prepare where they can order its ingredients repeatedly with one click.

In Bait, our goal is to make online grocery shopping a more convenient and fun experience for the customer and reducing the gap between planning your meals and ingredients and cooking them in real time.
